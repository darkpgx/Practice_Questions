Problems occured when installing Ruby on Rails

1. cannot access gem files due to permission
solution: set environment variable GEM_HOME and GEM_PATH to "~/.gem"

2. ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Errno::ENOENT)
   No such file or directory - /home_directory/.gem/gems/i18n-0.6.11
solution: not yet found


Setting environment variables:

vim ~/.bash_profile
add variable by typing: export variable_name="variable_value"

access by process.env.variable_name

using bash commands:

env | grep variable_name to check existance
set variable_name
remove by: unset variable_name

setting $HOME: echo ${HOME:=desired_home_directory}

this will bring you to the described home directory when cd is typed
